For this assignment I had to create an E-Commerce Back End so that a manager at an internet retail company could see, add, update, and delete products, categories, and tags from their back end. For each api route one can do get, put, post, and delete requests through insomnia. The user can also get and update products, tags, or categories through their respective id numbers. I also had to classify what type of data would be used and its restraints in the models section.
